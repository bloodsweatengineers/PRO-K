\section{Embedded software architecture}
A large part of the project pertains the control and generation of a PWM waveform described by
user input. To that end, the embedded software must be able to perform its generation duties whilst
recieving or outputting paramters/data. There are multiple ways of achieving said multitasking such as
polling or interrupt-driven execution. Since the required hardware does not have the ability to prioritise
specific interrupts, a pure interrup-driven approach was ruled out, instead, it was chosen to focus on a dual apporach. The routines with a deadline such as the waveform generation would work with interrupt while the routines without a deadline such as user interaction would work with a polling system.
